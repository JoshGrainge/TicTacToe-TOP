# TicTacToe-TOP
Tic Tac Toe Game

Simple tic tac toe game that asks for the players names,
then does the simple game loop, finally once a win condition
has been met display a win message. At any point the users 
can reset the game to start over.

The design document was provided by The Odin Project with the
main goal being to use as little global scope code as possible.
